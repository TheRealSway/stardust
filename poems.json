With a heavy heart, he let go of the past, Knowing that the love was just lust. He was tired of smiling while holding back tears. Though sadness lingered, he found peace in release, Understanding that sometimes, it's better to find inner peace. For in letting go, he found a new start, And embraced the hope of mending his broken heart."

My broken heart's never going to be healed 
It fought and lost once before 
Begged for a second chance ,but not anymore
Since then it's learned to close the door

Why hold on to a love that's no longer there
She ain't going to love me anymore and I'm aware

So I walked into her room 
But I was disguised 
She thinks we've been apart for a while 
But I was there the whole time

It's true it's me in disguise
I came to fulfil my last promise 
Hoping to solve this crisis "},
