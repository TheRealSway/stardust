With a heavy heart, he let go of the past, Knowing that the love was just lust. He was tired of smiling while holding back tears. Though sadness lingered, he found peace in release, Understanding that sometimes, it's better to find inner peace. For in letting go, he found a new start, And embraced the hope of mending his broken heart."
