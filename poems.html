        <h2>Searching For Hope</h2>
        <p>
            He held on to memories,<br>
            of their bond so strong,<br>
            But realized it was time to accept that they no longer belong.<br>
            With a heavy heart,<br>
            he let go of the past,<br>
            Knowing that the love was just lust<br>
            He was tired of smiling while holding back tears.<br>
            Though sadness lingered,<br>
            he found peace in release,<br>
            Understanding that sometimes,<br>
            it's better to find inner peace.<br>
            For in letting go,<br>
            he found a new start,<br>
            And embraced the hope of mending his broken heart.

        <h2>Me In Disguise</h2>
        <p>
            My broken heart's never going to be healed<br>
            It fought and lost once before<br>
            Begged for a second chance,<br>
            but not anymore<br>
            Since then it's learned to close the door<br>
            <br>
            Why hold on to a love that's no longer there?<br>
            She ain't going to love me anymore and I'm aware<br>
            <br>
            So I walked into her room<br>
            But I was disguised<br>
            She thinks we've been apart for a while<br>
            But I was there the whole time<br>
            <br>
            It's true it's me in disguise<br>
            I came to fulfil my last promise<br>
            Hoping to solve this crisis
